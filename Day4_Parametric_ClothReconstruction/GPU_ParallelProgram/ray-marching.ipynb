March along this ray in small steps, repeatedly asking \"am I inside an object yet?\" until you either hit something or reach a maximum distance.\n","Distance Fields: The magic happens with signed distance functions (SDFs). These mathematical functions tell you the shortest distance from any point in space to the nearest surface. If the distance is zero or negative, you've hit the surface.\n","\n","- **Sphere Marching:** A more efficient variant uses the distance field value as the step size. Since you know the closest surface is at least that distance away, you can safely jump that far without missing anything. This dramatically reduces the number of steps needed.\n","- **Advantages:** Ray marching excels at rendering smooth, organic shapes, fractals, and procedural geometry. It handles complex operations like blending, warping, and infinite detail naturally through mathematical functions.\n","\n","- **Applications:** Popular in demoscene productions, shader art, and procedural graphics. It's particularly useful for creating landscapes, clouds, and abstract mathematical visualizations.\n","- **Key Insight:** While traditional 3D graphics break objects into triangles, ray marching treats the entire scene as a mathematical function, allowing for incredibly complex and smooth surfaces with relatively simple code.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guillaume-Francois-3/publication/220792126/figure/fig4/AS:668488666451987@1536391526826/Notations-and-principle-of-a-classical-ray-marching-algorithm-to-compute-single.png\" height=500 width=700>\n","\n","Ray marching with sphere marching:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://www.tylerbovenzi.com/RayMarch/Assets/figure3.png\" height=400 width=700>"],"metadata":{"id":"dkEoFXbOxVrs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Taichi Vector\n","### Vector:\n","- A data type that groups multiple scalar values together (like a mathematical vector)\n","- Represents a single point in multi-dimensional space\n","- Used for positions, velocities, colors, or any grouped data\n","- Behaves like a single entity with multiple components\n","\n","### Taichi Field:\n","- A data structure that stores collections of data in memory\n","- Can be thought of as multi-dimensional arrays that live on GPU/CPU\n","- Must be declared with shape and data type: ti.field(ti.f32, shape=(100, 100))\n","- Stores actual simulation data that persists between kernel calls\n","- Can contain scalars, vectors, or matrices as elements\n","\n","### Key Differences:\n","- **Storage:** Vectors are temporary values used in computations, while fields are persistent memory structures that hold your simulation state.\n","- **Scope:** Vectors exist only during kernel execution, while fields persist throughout your program's lifetime.\n","- **Declaration:** Vectors are created on-the-fly, fields must be pre-declared with specific shapes and types.\n","- **Usage Pattern:** You typically store vectors inside fields.
